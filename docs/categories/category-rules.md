You can add as many rules as you want. But remember that a rule can also have multiple triggers.
It's advisable to just add more of them to one rule in order to keep a clean overview.

Using the rule editor you can add or edit rules.
There are different possibilities for adding rules you can create rules based on:

 - Display Name
 - IBAN
 - Discribtion
 - Other

  - Matches exactly
  - Starts with
  - Ends with
  - Regex
