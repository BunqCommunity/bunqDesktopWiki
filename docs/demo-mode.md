The sandbox mode is a testing option that uses the sandbox function from the bunq API.
This mode is great if you want to test out the bunqDesktop app and take a look for yourself instead of looking at screenshots. But please keep in mind there are limitations some of them are the following:

In the sandbox mode you can:

 - create monatary accounts
 - [request money](demo-mode-money.md)
 - make payments between your sandbox monetary accounts
 -   setup scheduled payments between your sandbox monetary accounts

In the sandbox mode you can't:

 - send real money
 - manage any cards
 - see statistics (because there are no simulated payments)
