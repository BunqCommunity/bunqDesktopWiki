# Contributing

Thanks for your interest in the project! I definitely am interested in feedback and ideas on things for this
project around formatting, emoji used, etc. Feel free to file issues to discuss changes!

**Working on your first Pull Request?** You can learn how from this *free* series

## Picking a feature or issue
Before you start working on something please **let us know** what you are planning to do first! Comment on the issue or create a new issue first so we prevent people from working on the same thing!

## Project setup

You're going to need [`git`](https://git-scm.com/) to get the project, and [`python`](https://nodejs.org/en/)/[`pip`](https://yarnpkg.com/) to install dependencies and build the site.

1. Fork and clone the repo
2. Install the required dependencies (Getting started on [Mkdocs Material Design](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/getting-started/))
3. Run `mkdocs serve` to  start a local site and test your changes.
4. Create a branch for your pull request
